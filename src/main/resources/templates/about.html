                    <p>Halkbank is a Turkish bank, first incorporated in 1933 as a state-owned bank. After growing
                        throughout much of the twentieth century,
                        it began absorbing smaller-sized state banks around the turn of the millennium.
                        Halkbank is now a publicly traded company, although the majority stakeholder remains the Turkish
                        government.
                        Halkbank is a bank that offers vehicle loans, housing loans, consumer loans and commercial
                        loans.
                        A number of scandals and controversies involving the bank emerged in the 2010s, some of which
                        culminated in arrests of its executives.</p>
